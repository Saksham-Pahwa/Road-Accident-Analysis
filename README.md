# üöó Road Accident Analysis Project  

## üìä Project Overview  
This project is a data visualization analysis of road accident data, aimed at understanding the factors influencing road casualties. It provides insights into accident patterns, including the impact of road surface conditions, light conditions, vehicle types, and accident locations.  

I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to offer a comprehensive and insightful view of road safety dynamics. This dashboard helps identify high-risk scenarios, compare casualty trends across different road types, and explore the influence of environmental factors on accidents.

## üéØ Objective  
The main goals of this project were to:  
- Visualize casualty patterns to understand accident trends.  
- Identify key risk factors such as road type, light conditions, and weather impact.  
- Analyze vehicle involvement and location-based accident distribution.  
- Showcase my data visualization skills using Excel through dynamic dashboards.

## üîç Insights Explored  
This dashboard provides insights into:  
- **Total Casualties:** 417,883, categorized into Fatal, Serious, and Slight casualties.  
- **Casualties by Road Type:** Single carriageways recorded the highest number of accidents.  
- **Impact of Weather Conditions:** Most accidents occurred on **dry roads**, followed by **wet roads**.  
- **Casualties by Light Condition:** Majority of accidents happened during **daylight**, highlighting visibility as a key factor.  
- **Vehicle Type Involvement:** Cars were involved in the highest number of casualties.  

These insights can be used by:  
- **Traffic Authorities** to enhance road safety measures.  
- **Urban Planners** to design safer road networks.  
- **Policy Makers** to create targeted safety campaigns.

## üìä Dashboard Highlights  
Key features of the dashboard include:  
- **Dynamic Filters:** Allowing users to filter data by:  
  - Accident Date and Time  
  - Road Surface Condition (Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice)  
  - Light Condition (Daylight, Dark)  
  - Vehicle Type Involved (Car, Bus, Motorcycle, etc.)  
  - Accident Location (Urban, Rural)  
- **Monthly Trend Analysis:** Visualizing casualty trends across different periods.  
- **Casualties by Road Type:** Understanding how different road types impact accident severity.  
- **Impact of Light Condition:** Analyzing the influence of visibility on accident frequency.  
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Categorizing accidents by the type of vehicle involved.
