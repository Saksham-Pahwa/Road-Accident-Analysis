# Road Accident Data Analysis 🚧💥🚗

## 📌Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard for analyzing road accident data, offering insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), monthly trends, and accident distributions based on road type and surface conditions. It includes in-depth analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and contributing factors, helping to identify critical areas for improving road safety and decision-making.


## 🔍Critical Insights

- **Total Casualties Recorded:** 417,883
- **Most Dangerous Road Type:** Roundabouts had the highest number of casualties (26,828).
- **Weather Impact:** Most accidents occurred on **dry roads** (279,445 casualties), followed by **wet roads** (115,261 casualties).
- **Speed Limit Trend:** Most accidents happened on roads with a **30 mph speed limit**.
- **Most Common Light Condition:** The majority of accidents occurred during **daylight** conditions.

## 📊Key Insights

- **Peak Accident Days:** Higher accident occurrences on weekdays, especially **Monday and Friday**.
- **Time of Accidents:** Most accidents happen during **rush hours (8-10 AM & 4-7 PM)**.
- **Road Type Impact:** **Single carriageways** report the highest number of accidents.
- **Weather Conditions:** **Fine weather** accounts for most accidents, indicating human error as a major factor.
- **Surface Conditions:** Majority of accidents occur on **dry roads**, but wet and icy roads show a higher severity rate.
- **Vehicle Involvement:** **Cars & motorcycles** are the most common vehicles involved in accidents.

## 📊Dataset Description

The dataset contains multiple features describing accident details, including:

- `Accident_Index`: A unique identifier for each accident record.
- `Accident Date`: The date when the accident occurred.
- `Day_of_Week`: The specific day of the week when the accident took place.
- `Accident_Severity`: Categorization of accidents as Fatal, Serious, or Slight.
- `Junction_Control`: The type of control present at the junction, if applicable.
- `Road_Surface_Conditions`: The condition of the road surface at the time of the accident (e.g., Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice).
- `Weather_Conditions`: The weather at the time of the accident.
- `Number_of_Casualties`: The total number of casualties resulting from the accident.
- `Number_of_Vehicles`: The number of vehicles involved in the accident.
- `Speed_limit`: The speed limit of the road where the accident occurred.
- `Urban_or_Rural_Area`: Whether the accident happened in an urban or rural setting.
- `Vehicle_Type`: The type of vehicle(s) involved in the accident.
